    "### Features of R\n",
    "1. Compiler independent: R interprets the code you provide without compiling it.\n",
    "2. Performing multiple calculation with vectors: R allows to apply function to the whole vector in a single operation without need of a loop.<br>\n",
    "    Example:<br>\n",
    "        > x=1:5  will assign values 1 to 5 to vector x<br>\n",
    "        > x+2  will add 2 to each element of x  \n",
    "3. Initially R was developed to perform statistical calculation. Later R was expanded to do non-statistical task like data processing, graphical visualisation and analysis."

    "### Benefits of using R\n",
    "1. R is an open sourced license that is anyone can download and modify code thus it is called “free as in speech”. Since one can download and use R free of charge it is also referred as “free as in beer”.  \n",
    "2. R works on all type of softwares(windows, linux, Mac) and hardwares.  \n",
    "3. It supports extensions. Thus developers can write their own software codes and distribute it in the form of add on packages.\n",
    "4. It provides an engaged community. R has an active mailing list, question and answer website, blog, social network and conferences.  \n",
    "5. It connects with other languages. Several R package link R to file system, databases and applications like C, C++, java, python, etc. Packages like foreign, Roracle, RODBC enables you to read data from SPSS, SAS, stata, oracle, etc.\n"
