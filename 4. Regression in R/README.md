# Regression Analysis 
Regression Analysis is a statistical process for estimating the
relationships between the dependent variables or criterion variables and one or more
independent variables or predictors. Three major uses for regression analysis are determining
the strength of predictors, forecasting an effect, and trend forecasting.

###  Regression analysis and its type in R
Regression analysis is a statistical tool to estimate the relationship between two or
more variables. There is always one response variable and one or more predictor variables.
Regression analysis is widely used to fit the data accordingly and further, predicting the data
for forecasting. There are mainly three types of Regression in R programming that is widely
used.<br>
They are:<br>
[1. Linear Regression](https://github.com/prasadposture/R-for-Everyone/blob/main/4.%20Regression%20in%20R/01.%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)<br>
[2. Multiple Regression]()<br>
[3. Logistic Regression]()<br><br>
We will see one by one with plenty of examples. There, we will be using all the things we have learned so far in R.
